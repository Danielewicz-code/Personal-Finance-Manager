# Personal-Finance-Manager
This Python code creates a simple personal finance manager using Tkinter for the GUI. The application allows users to:

Register Income: Add and record income.

Manage Money: Add expenses with details and check recorded expenses.

Reset Month: Reset financial data at the end of the month.

the goal for me to do this is to learn how to use OOP and Tkinter why not.
